# Unity Custom Package Template

A template for making custom unity packages.

## Adding Runtime code

1. Create a folder called Runtime
2. Add Scripts and other work, you can add folders like Script, Prefabs, Resources etc - just like you do for projects, keep it clean
3. Inside the Runtime folder. create an Assembly Definition file - name it as CompanyName.PackageName ( for example: CodeLibrary24.CustomPackageTemplate )
4. Add the root namespace as CompanyName.PackageName

## Adding Editor code

1. Create a folder called Editor
2. Add Scripts and other work, you can add folders like Script, Prefabs, Resources etc - just like you do for projects, keep it clean
3. Inside the Editor folder. create an Assembly Definition file - name it as CompanyName.PackageName.Editor ( for example: CodeLibrary24.CustomPackageTemplate.Editor )
4. Make sure to select only Editor in the platform and keep de-select other platforms
5. Add the root namespace as CompanyName.PackageName

## Adding dependencies

1.Add the following in the package.json file:-
  
 "dependencies": {
     "com.codelibrary24.dummydependency": "1.0.0",
     "com.codelibrary24.dummydependency": "1.0.1"
 },


 ## Adding Samples
 
 1. Create a folder called Sample~
 2. Inside Sample~ create a folder called SampleFolder_01
 3. If you want to add one more sample, Inside Sample~ create a folder called SampleFolder_02 (you can create as many as you want)
 4. Add the following in the package.json file:-
 
     "samples": [
        {
            "displayName": "Dummy Sample 01",
            "description": "This is a Dummy description",
            "path": "Samples~/SampleFolder_01"
        },
        {
            "displayName": "Dummy Sample 02",
            "description": "This is a Dummy description",
            "path": "Samples~/SampleFolder_02"
        }
    ],
 
 6. Samples~ is not shown inside unity as long as the '~' is part of the name, hence when you want to edit the samples, remove the ~ and add it back when you are done and ready to publish the package.
    

## Important
1. Package names should always be lower case for example "com.companyname.packagename"
